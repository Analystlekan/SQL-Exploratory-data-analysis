# SQL Data Cleaning and Exploration Project: Layoffs Analysis

## Overview

This project involves cleaning and exploring a dataset (`layoffs`) containing information about layoffs across various companies, industries, countries, and dates using SQL queries. The primary goals are to ensure data accuracy through cleaning and to derive insights into layoffs trends through exploration.

## Contents

1. **Data**: Contains the raw dataset (`layoffs.csv`) used for analysis.
2. **SQL Queries**: Includes SQL scripts (`data_cleaning.sql` and `data_exploration.sql`) for data cleaning and exploration.
3. **Documentation**: This README.md file provides an overview of the project.

## Data Cleaning Steps

### Step 1: Importing the Dataset

- **Dataset**: Imported `layoffs.csv` into the SQL database.

### Step 2: Initial Assessment and Cleaning

- **Handling Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate entries from the dataset.
- **Managing Missing Values**: Handled missing values in critical fields (e.g., total_laid_off, date).

### Step 3: Standardizing Data Formats

- **Date Standardization**: Ensured consistent date formats across the dataset.
- **Data Consistency**: Checked and corrected inconsistencies in company names and other categorical data.

### Step 4: Correcting Anomalies

- **Data Anomalies**: Addressed any anomalies or outliers in the dataset.
- **Verification**: Verified data integrity and correctness after cleaning operations.

## Data Exploration Steps

### Step 1: Descriptive Statistics

- **Total Layoffs**: Calculated the total number of layoffs.
- **Percentage Laid Off**: Analyzed the percentage of employees laid off.
- ** percentage laid of by cpmpanies**: Analyzed the percentage of companies with  laid off.

### Step 2: Analyzing Trends

- **Top Contributors to Layoffs**: Identified companies and industries with the highest layoffs.
- **Country Analysis**: Analyzed layoffs distribution by country.
- **Time Analysis**: Explored layoffs trends over time (e.g., monthly, yearly).

## Next Steps

The cleaned dataset (`layoffs`) and exploration findings provide valuable insights into layoffs trends by industry, company, country, and time, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
